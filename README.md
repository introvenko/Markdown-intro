# VOLODYMYR: *former teacher / present student / future Fullstack Developer*


Wow... This is so difficult to write about myself, but I've done it so much times during Dutch lessons in CVO. *Misschien, mag ik in het Nederlands vertelen over mij?*<br>
Okay, I'll start.<br>
I want to start my story with one of the most stupid jokes in my life.

## Dat ben ik.
Hello to everyone, who will read this! My name is **Volodymyr**.<br>
I'm THIRTY *(no, I'm not crying at that moment)*.ðŸ˜­<br>
I'm from **UKRAINE** ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦, but last two years I live in **Belgium** ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª.<br>
During my two years in Belgium I've had some success in learning Dutch, visited some famous Belgian cities *(Ghent and Bruges are staying in my heart 4ever)* and then I wanted to try something new.  

25th of June 2024 has become one of the most important day for me since I came to Belgium. Why? Finally I start my studying in Becode to become a *Fullstack Developer* in future. I want to write more, but I think, I haven't so much time to do this.

Next step.<br>
## Top-3: I've never thought that I could do these three *most surprising* things.
- **Speaking Dutch**: I've always wanted to learn German to understand Rammstein songs, but... happened as it happened. And I can't say that I'm not *tevreden*.
- **137**: number of books, which I've read from the 1st of January till 25th of June.
- **Become a Becode student**: I've felt at once, and I was thinking I'd fall again. Till that iconic Monday (June 17).

## I like this the most in the whole universe.
- *The best **wife** in the whole universe*
- *The best **cat** in the whole universe*
- *My books and music*

## What I want to achieve as a developer during Becode
I've come to Becode for my future. I wanna change my occupation and begin working. Finally. Studying Dutch, English and other things are good, but I really want to start my first job in Belgium.<br>
During Becode training I wanted to improve my knowledge in HTML, CSS; to understand JS and learn some other thing. But for now I wanna understand **Terminal** as perfect as it's possible.

## FEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAARRRRRRSSSSðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜¨
I am not the most cowardly person, and I can't say that I have many fears. But I have so much things, which I don't like or find them ugly.
- spiders
- big frogs
- big insects
- snakes
- big dogs
- water (I can't swimming)
- geese
- wasps
- bees
- hippo's
- driving (because I can't driving)
etc.

## I'm looking forward to:
- **start working** (reading books, watching Netflix, listening to Spotify is nice, but sometimes I feel myself so bored)
- **become a professional in FullStack**
- **Stephen King will never die**
- **FC Dynamo Kyiv will win the UEFA Champions League** (imagine, that I didn't write this)
- **my first salary** in some company in Belgium
- visit **Munich, Vienna, Stockholm, The Hague and Milan**
- **open a publishing house when I'm retired**

## The three things I value the most in working as a team
1. Team-working
2. Mutual aid
3. Full involving
4. Shared motivation
5. Be hard-working
6. Understand my jokes and my sense of humour.
